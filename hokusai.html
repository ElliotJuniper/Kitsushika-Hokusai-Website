                His most noticeable japanese writings were called 'Hokusai'. During that time it was very common for artists to keep the subjects of their pieces as popular actors or courtesans.

                He abanonded this normality by creating many pictures (and woodblock prints) of landscapes, ordinary people and rural Japan. His most famous work is the 46 prints that form the 'Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji' and are now recognized all around the world.
