                'The Great Wave off Kanagawa' is a woodblock print by the Japanese ukiyo-e artist Hokusai. I twas published sometime between 1829 and 1833 in the late Edso period as the first print in Hokusai's series, Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. The image depicts an enormous wave threatening three boats off the coast in the Sagami Bay while Mount Fuji rises in the background. Sometimes assumed to be a tsunami, the wave is most probably a large wave caused by a storm.

                The woodblock print is notably Hokusai's most famous work and is often distinguished as the most recognizable japanese art piece in the world.
